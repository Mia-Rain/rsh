v0.0.0.8
-- after a long hiatus pull() is finally implemented
---- `$remote_url` & `$pull_path` are now used for this
  >> `$pull_path` & path based pulls need testing still
  >>>> currently there is no support for a file:// proto
  >> repos going forward will need to define `$remote_url`
  >>>> to allow users to run `pull` without having a copy in `$push_path`
---- `$remote_latest` is now implemented
  >> this exists as a system to prevent the requirement of ln(1)
  >>>> previously ln(1) was required in order to form linking to latest
  >>>> without this grab() would fail without additional arguments
  >>>>>> `$remote_latest` works by providing a path and url
  >>>>>> where the file in path is automatically updated
  >>>>>> and the config is pulled from url
  >>>>>> to load the latest into a `$latest` variable
---- testing is no longer done with dash
  >> previously I was using a manually packaged dash
  >>>> however after my last install collapsed after python issues
  >>>> I lost access to dash, and testing has been done with freebsd sh since
---- bail() has been redone
  >> to use exit codes properly
---- confload()/confload_l1() are now implemented
  >> former loading a config at url and latter loading line 1 only
---- config() is now implemented
  >> this allows users to directly interact with confedit()
  >>>> taking $1 as variable to change
  >>>> and $2 as the new value for it
---
v0.0.0.781 & v0.0.0.782
-- a major bug was discovered in db_build()
---- this bug caused issues with multi-level directories with multiple files

----- ./ROADMAP has been removed
----- ./example.conf has been updated
  >>>> a lot of shit in here is literally unimplemented
  >>>> TODOs are now present

  >>>> as such rsh is now just a dash script
  >>>> this will change post alpha with milang
  >>>> but that is a long time away
----- various improvements
  >>>> shcat() is now present
  >>>> many while read loops are now for loops using IFS
  >>>> confedit() has been improved again
  >>>>>> usage has not changed but it can now actually "unset" variables
  >>>> push now has proper --dry support
  >>>>>> push now additionally unsets push_ready as it was meant to
  >>>> help() was redone a lot
  >>>>>> using shcat/EOF instead of printf
  >>>> init() is now gone
  >>>>>> init() only still exists for compatibility

  >>>> commit() can init projects on demand

  >>>> is now hiding rsh.conf
---- ./docs/confedit have been updated
  >>>> confedit() was adjusted to use `$1` as `$conf_file`
