rsh - RevisionSH
-- git replacement in mostly pure sh!
---
Status
-- this is very WIP still
-- rsh does not currently work but progress is being made
---- stay tuned...
---
Usage
-- see ./rsh help for usage info
---- see ./docs for more info
---
Dependencies
-- a POSIX compliant shell 
---- dash, ash, bash or yash should work
-- curl
---- used to copy/create files & directories
-- see sh-caveats for more info
---
Plans
-- Minimal code base
-- Written in shm
---- distributed as sh
-- No network stack
---- changes are pushed to a folder
---- allowing for an interchangeable network stack
---- nfs/sshfs, etc or even nothing can be used!
-- Hooks!
---- hook support for all methods
---- git's hook support is rather lackluster
-- Plugin support
---- git integration
---- web front-end
  >> heavy integration
---
Server Setup
-- rsh is entirely client-side; simply set $push_path to a folder
---- all pushed changes will be sent there
---- sshfs/nfs/ftp etc can be used for a server setup
