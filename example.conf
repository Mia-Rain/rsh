# defaults to grab,init,revi,push,pull
# additional items can be added

# detected via cli automatically
# but can be manually set for odd configurations
config_hidden="false"
# when init is run a config is generated at ./.rsh.conf
# set config_hidden to false to generate ./rsh.conf instead
# plugins should use ./${config_hidden}rsh.conf for the local config
# $config_hidden is redefined by cl() to `.` if true
db_file=""
# set db_file if you wish to use a separate file for storing db_items
# large projects will have large databases 
# having the db inside the local rsh.conf may be annoying
db_findHidden=""

# by default db() ignores hidden files
# note that issues may arise due to hidden git files
# also note that db is only used for remote grab calls

init_post="hook"
# $init_pre would run before init and $init_post after
local_version=""
# set in local project configs & remote configs

# the remote path from which to pull data
# used when != to $push_remote
# this is set within local project configs
