confedit()
---
Usage
-- `[$conf_file=CONF] confedit 'header_var=value' 'header2_var2=value2' ... ./CONF`
---- set $conf_file to configuration file if supplying more then 9 edits
---- if supplying less than 8 edits either set $conf_file or supply the file as the last argument
---
Reason
-- confedit() should be called to edit the values of a configuration file
---- this should mostly be used by plugins and wrapper commands
---
Routine - as of v0.0.0.7
-- set $conf_edit based on $1 then shift 1
---- file is expected and REQUIRED at $1
---- arguement in $1 WILL be LOST after setting $conf_file
-- loop over each line in $conf_file
---- call argshift() and supply all current arguments
  >> see docs/argshift
---- set output to $conf_out
-- loop over every argument
---- determine if the current argument matches the expected syntax for edits
  >> otherwise is must be a file and the last argument; if it is not call bail()
  >>>> see docs/bail
---- then check if the current argument is found anywhere within $conf_out
---- if not; modify $conf_out to contain the missing argument
-- check if $conf_file is writable; and write updated data if it is
---- if not call bail()
