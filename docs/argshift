argshift()

Legend
-- current line
---- $p
-- current argument
---- $1
---
Reason
-- called by confedit()
---- used to loop over >9 arguments without having to deal with `set --`
  >> during testing usage of `set --` would cause some elements of arguments to be lost
  >> using a secondary function prevents the need to reset $@
Routine - as of v0.0.0.66
-- loop over every given argument
---- if the current argument matches the current line passed by confedit()
---- then change the value of the current line to the current argument
  >> written as `[ "${p%=*}" = "${1%=*}" ] && p="$1"`
  >>>> expansion should remove everything after first =
---- otherwise do nothing
---- output current line 
  >> `e "$p"`
