---- <${plugin-name}[.shm]>
  >>>> a file with the name of your plugin is /required/
  >>>> this should be the main script of your plugin
  >>>> containing any functions used
  >>>> or any variables to be set
---- [install.sh]
  >>>> use an install script with confedit()
  >>>> to install plugins
---- [${plug-name}.conf]
  >>>> a config file for your plugin
  >>>> if used /MUST/ be named ${plugin-name}.conf
  >>>> a plugin config is advised /against/
  >>>> all configuration should be done in [./]rsh.conf
-- Code requirements
---- rsh plugins don't have to be pure sh
  >>>> however they require a sh wrapper that rsh can source
---- scripts should source rsh for confedit()
  >>>> `. $(which rsh)`
---- additionally function names should be unique to prevent collision
  >>>> THERE IS NO SAFE-GUARD FOR THIS
